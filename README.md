# IoT for Agribusiness
## About this course
In this course the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm and related technologies,
applied to the agribusiness vertical is presented, starting with the production
processes, up to modern LPWAN networks or battery technology. A hands-on
approach and project-based learning will be employed to introduce the different
technologies necessary for the deployment of sensor networks, asset
geolocation, traceability within the agribusiness sector, or food logistics among
others, utilizing the Internet.
Students taking this course are expected to have prior knowledge of Python or
any other high-level programming language. 

## Main topics
* Introduction, the agribusiness sector.
* El paradigma de IoT.
* LPWAN networks.
* RFID technology.
* Cloud services.
* Low consumption electronics.

## What you will learn
* An overview of the technologies that allow us to carry the IoT paradigm
specifically to the agribusiness sector.
* Ability to analyze, specify, or design different types of networks
LPWAN applied to the agro-industrial sector, from the sensor nodes
to the platforms (middleware) in the Cloud for managing the
information.
* Ability to analyze, specify, or design solutions based on
RFID technology and others, for traceability, data recording, and
tracking items within the agribusiness production chains.
* Capacity and practical use of tools to design, implement,
and measure in the laboratory, very low consumption sensors connected to the Internet.

## What you will need:
* Previous knowledge of embedded systems.
* IoT Laboratory.
* Hardware (LoRaWAN Gateway, LoRaWAN nodes, NB-IoT Kits, GPS kits, UHF RFID kits).
